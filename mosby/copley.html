<H2> Tryials of folding membrane protein with alpha helix constrained to
the membrane region </H2>
<BR>

<P>
Using coarse graind force field for the protein molecules
a folding of proteins with transmembrane helices are
simulated. This page is to demonstrate some of current on-going project 
for a imporved structure prediction methd for transmembrane
proteins. Detalied method will be described soon.
<BR>
Although the program code is under major development, we are plan
to share for other studies ...
