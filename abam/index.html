      <p>
      In order to edit a supramolecular structure composed of multiple biopolymers with computer software, the polygon mesh model is the useful modeling object describing shape of molecules with a size of several nano maters. We may also expect the rigid body dynamics calculation can be applied using general-purpose 3D CG software. Here, our example of using Blender, a 3D CG animation software is demonstrated. Please note the illustrated motions are not determined experimentaly by biologist, but are predictions. They will be tools for understanding biological discussions. Blender is free software, and we are developing numbers of script file for Blender. Please download these scripts to modify and exchange the model, so that we might help biologist to construct biologically correct animations based on structural studies for proteins and biological macromoleculesby exchanging and improving Blender scripts.

          To find a nice fit of cylinder models for the observed iso-surface mesh object a wireframe display was useful overlaying the structure. As a result, many filaments had a length of about 4 µm, and filaments of about 7.5 µm were observed. The size will differ depending on the condition of the specimen. A mesh structure model by cylinders of microtubule that fits the three-dimensional volume of the observed microtubule are constructed.

Polarity of microtubule filaments are supposed to oposite direction. In this model a kinesin multimer complex has two arms where the motor primitive is assigned to slide on the microtubule filaments. Thus, four arms of kinesin multimer complex used in the real experiment will work in the same way.

      <p>
        The muscle filaments that make up skeletal muscle are arranged in a hexagonal lattice.  It is known that vertebrate muscle has a unique layout of thick and thin filaments compared to the other spices. On muscle contraction, the lattice spacing becomes wider according to the shorting of the muscle cell. This model was made to investigate the intermolecular interaction between actin and myosin of each filaments in the sarcomere model by reconstructing the structure of the filament lattice that accompanies lattice spacing change. The particle system facility in Blender was applied using low resolution polygon models of actin and myosin molecules. Basically the particle system in blender provide multiple child objects grow on a parent object, and we nested additional particle system objects nested to the children object, i.e, one is a particle model with leaves on the branches of the tree, and the other is a particle model of the trunk with multiple branches.

Both lattice spacings were also modified by keyframes. To check the molecular interactions between the filament, camera zooming is nessesary that is also programed by the keyframe.

        There are ways to layout duplicated objects in Blender. For example, Group function allows us to register and reuse the parts that consist of multiple objects, we can build a similar model with the Gorup function. In addition, a python script can be used to copy or place multiple objects, or the objects created with particles can be converted into ordinary objects. Using script is also useful to change the attributes of multiple objects at once and animate them.
        We also tried to construct a much detailed sarcomere model using python script that is avalable upon request before release.

      <p>
        Since smooth muscle does not have a sarcomere structure, its detailed structure would be experimentally explored in near future. In order to discuss various force generation mechanisms of biomolecules, we tried to predict a filament model of smooth muscle based on literature. A unit structure of contraction is composed of actin filaments from the textbook explanation. This unit structures will be linked together to form the filament network and the portion connecting filaments would becomes a dens body in the smooth muscle. The contraction of the whole network were possible by shortening of the unit structure.

               <h4>particle method for dynamic motion</h4>
               <p>
			         The particle system works for variety of subjects for different subjects to make an object model with duplicated child objects, this general-purpose functions are not always applicable for our purpose. It is often diffucult to create the desired model even when trying to proceed with the manual. So modifying the already created script is good strategy. For example, there is also an addon that makes it easy to create tree branches and leaves, so we may try that. In particular, the Rotation panel, we can specify the method of changing the orientation of the object to be generated, but since it shakes randomly, you will be searching for a good value for appearance.
               </p>
               <h4>adapting latest Blender 2.8</h4>
               <p>
                There is a big change in the latest version, blender2.8. The scripts here develped in blender 2.7 will work, but the new blender 2.8 will be easier for many people. We will moving to new version soon.
