      Describing functions of biological macromolecules are demonstrated by computer animation using 3D CG software Blender. Here the free software Blender allows smooth exchange of the animation scripts developed among users. There are blender script files and the parts of the molecular objects are demonstrated. Although these models and scene graphics needs to be improved for the production uses in animation studios, this development project is ongoing to provide the parts of molecular animation.

        There are method to move nucleic acid polymer along the helical path with Blender. In this case Lattice Modifier was applied because it is useful to control directions of nucleic acid base which should be paired to the corresponging template. Three Lattice objects for the RNA and DNA double helix was made from the PDB coordidnate by a hand work. Array of nucleic acid residues are placed on an Z axis and motion along Z axis is applied. Then this rows of residues are constrained to move in the Lattice. This method has limitation of Lattice length (maximum 64), and we may probably need to take different method eventually.

The sliding of two filaments may be caused by the myosin head. The laver-arm hypothesis explains the movements are considered to provide a force to pull a thin filament. The model shows an example of such a motion where the interactions between myosin head on the actin polymers. Using these models, we may also examine the long distance walk of myosin head may also examine on this model.

Blender version 2.5 introduced a major improvement in the particle system which allows object move by physics simulation. The actin filament is made with 78 helical arrays of rectangles, where the "emitter" mode is used to locate actin on the helix, taking "emit form" as "Faces" at the same number of emission 78. The times for the emission start and stop are controlled to give a good elongation cycle. There is "keyed" option in the Physics tab in the object property sheet, the emitted particle target are specified. Two big rectangle planes are used as the targets so that particle traverses to the other end of the filament. This is a chain of the particle emitter in Blender specifying beginning and ending time. In case the motions are not always satisfactory for the use in other animation script, we may convert these motions into the sequence of key frame animation..

The motions of microtubules are tracked by attached fluorescence by the microscope. This animation picture demonstrates how the molecules reside in this plate. The motion of microtubule is in the predefined path because a realistic simulation for the motility is not available.

      <p>A hypothetical working model of alpha-amylase, the enzyme for the hydration of starch. A hypothetical working model of alpha-amylase, the enzyme for the hydration of starch is demonstrated. An amylose, a chain with 10 glucose monomers, approaches to the active site of the alpha-amylase and divided into some maltose molecules in a raw. The path was predefined from handworks, because it was not yet known how the molecule recruits this substrate into the active site. The thermal vibration of the amylase is introduced by a composition of the vibrational mode from the normal mode analysis. The amplitude was 5 times larger than the room temperature behavior to exaggerate the movements. The active site of the enzyme stays in an original conformation, while the loop regions move a lot suggesting some help for the work of this enzyme.

<!--ONE --------------------------------------------  -->
               <h3>Tiling Windows</h3>
               <p>
                When working on the multiple windows or panels tiled inside Blender, there are nice ways to handle the triangle icon. First, if you drag the digonal corner of this triangle outside the tile, the tiled window is marged to the adjacent tile and disappears. The adjacent tile have to be single tiled. These are directions out of the two base of isoscales right-triangle. Second, if drag inside to the tile, new tile is created. It is a in-bound direction of the hypotenuse. Right clock menu may not be useful for tiling although the official wiki of Blender advices.
               </p>
               <h3>Duplicating Objects without Data</h3>
               <p>
			   Sometimes duplicated objects without data does not act correctly with bone animation. In that case making the objects real works well.
               </p>
                <h3>Working on Big Model</h3>
                <p>
In general, when you place more than 1000 objects, Blender becomes difficult to operate. Even if I add more memory or change the graphics card, it doesn't help much. In particular, ball-stick models and space-filling models tend to be heavy, as atomic models of proteins contain several thousand atoms. Additionally, extensions such as Bioblender often take a very long time to load. It seems to be unavoidable when we create objects using Blender's API. However, once you save it to a Blender file, it will load fast, but the overall operation will remain slow. Since a sphere is displayed as a polyhedron, it will be somewhat lighter if it is made into an octahedron. Many complex polygonal models can be loaded and manipulated relatively quickly, so ribbon models are no problem. For example, when importing the hemoglobin tetramer of PDB model 1A00, there are approximately 4000 atoms, and it is difficult to handle a model in which all atoms are represented as spheres. A model with only the α carbon has 794 residues, which is the usable range. On the other hand, the ribbon model had 280,000 polygons and consumed about 56MB of memory, but it did not become heavy.

				<h3>Mesh deformation along a Curve</h3>
                <p>
Blender has several different methods, but two methods are useful. If there is no deformation along the curve, either FollowCurve of the constraint, or Deform-Curve of the modifier if there is deformation. In both cases, the parallel movement motion is placed on a curve, so when inserting motion with a keyframe, it is not possible to specify the desired position while looking at the curve. Specify with a variable. For example, if you assign the x-axis to a curve, change the object's transform value and move it to the desired position. At this time, the y and z components may deviate from the curve, causing the mesh to become distorted. Also, it seemed easy to change the orientation of the object by changing the normal of the curve. If you try to directly manipulate an object, the orientation is different from that on the screen, so it is difficult to manipulate the object in the desired orientation.

               	<h3>Camera works</h3>
                <p>
Blender documents explain a method to place the camera on a specified curve and take a picture of the point of interest, but adding constraints to the path will make it troublesome, so just specify a few points as key frames. That was enough. In this case, you can change the point of interest or angle with each keyframe. You can change it naturally by selecting the camera as an object, displaying the camera view, and moving with the G key or rotating with the R key.

                <p>
               Among variations of video format conversion tools available, ffmpeg was mainly used because of rich functions and low problem rate. In our development days, mpeg2 format was useful, however, currently mpeg4 format at specific codec is nice to take.
