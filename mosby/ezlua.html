		<h3>EZLUA</h3>
		<p>An Easy Lua interface</p>
		<p>This is an experiment of an alternative C-language API of Lua language. It was named EZLUA, trying to make it easier to embed Lua in a small C-program. The main proposition is to minimize the stack management required in programming with C-language API of Lua. Although the code is quite preliminary work, comments are welcome so that we consider possible improvements.</p>
		<h3>A sample implementation</h3>
		<p>Functions of EZLUA are actually simple wrappers to the formal C language API of Lua. In a tar ball of this experimental source code, a small test program is provided to demonstrate EZLUA functions. It was tested by gcc on a Linux box. Please note it will be updated soon.
