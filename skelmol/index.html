		<h2>Skeletal Animation for Moleuclar Models</h2>

			Skeletal animation allows polygon models of the 3DCG object animate 
			by means of skeletal bones superimposed into the structure.

					Example1 -- Flexibility of hemoglobin molecule</h3>
					Conformational change is considered to allow oxgen binding process, as demonstrated in Wikipedia. Thermal fluctuation of hemoglobin molecule is yet to be explored.

		<h4>We develop computer programs for molecular modeling</h4>
		<p>Programs are written in Lua, so download Lua interpreter from 
		www.lua.org or various repositories. They are experimental implementation
		that could be refined for a laboratory use, or embedding to the existing programs.
		They are developed and tested on Linux and Windows platforms, and most probably
		ok in MacOS.	



		
		</p><p> Following movies demonstrate how the models are animated.
			The method is described in a manuscript:
			"Skeletal animation for visualizing dynamic molecular shapes of macromolecules" by Yutaka Ueno, Shinya Muraoka and Tetsuo Sato.

		<p> An animation of the thremal fluctuation of protein molecule is demonstrated. The motion of the atomic model is created from normal mode analysis at ProMode database for the protein data bank
			(PDB) atomic models. Then our method generates the skeletal bones to animate the molecular model in the format of BVH motion capture file. Using Blender the animation is generated. With the superposition
			of the normal mode waves gives a typical thermal fluctuation of the protein.

		<p>	The program convert the simulation result output file into the motion
			capture file BVH.

		<h4>Usage</h4>
		<p>Among files from the normal mode calculation, only files with extension .flcatmE
		for all mode are used. Unpack these files in a directory 1amy-result/.
		There are parameters to modify amplitude or phase shift for combining each mode
		that could be defined in arrays: amplitude[] and phase[].

		</p>
				<h4>Descrioton</h4>
		<p>This program first make a list of group for protein residues
that is converted to the skeletal bones.
Then the generated groups have a skeleton bone whose
geometry is make by averaging atomic coordinates data
assgined in the group. Then the vector of the bone is also
calcurated by the sequence of atoms in the group.

The calcuration of the vector of the bone was modified
at emprical mannar, so that the apperance of the final appearance
yield a reasonable direction for the given group.
Since the bone is used only for the visualization handle,
the precise definition is not needed. Small differences
in the bone geometry does not really make difference
in the final animated structure of this method.

Then the groups of residue in the pdb data is converted
to the BVH skeleton description. Here we take a flat structure
without a parent relationship between skeleton bone.
It is useful because the bones are not tightly connected
in ths grouping method for the protein. In case the all groups chains are connected as sequence of child bones,
calculation of atomic coordinates becomes complicated that
is not good approach.

The superposition of wave is applied in the function XYZadd()
that is saved into the data structure bonedata[].motion[]
The simple addition with variable amplitude and phase[] shift
value would also be specified.
The calculated osscilation vectors are applied to the
atomic coordinates, then the group are divided into three part
and these subgroup positions are used to calcculate the
rigid translation matrix that most well describe the motion
of atom in the group. Then the matrix is converted into
Euler angles that will be saved into the BVH file.

are obtained asfor Â&nbsp;by using three segment of the asaved and that will
be written in the BVH data file.

molecular shape depicted in polygon mesh, various kind of the molecular

		<h4>Usage</h4>
		<p>Following file names are set: TFILE for the trajectoroy file name, DFILE for the DSSP file, and BFILE for the output BVH file name. Groups are made with maximum residue length MAXLEN. 

		In a rare condition where the 3 atoms are located in a line, the matrix calculations to fit two conformation may fail. They can be avoided by
