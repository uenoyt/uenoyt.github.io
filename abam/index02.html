      <p>
      In order to edit a supramolecular structure composed of multiple biopolymers with computer software, the polygon mesh model is the useful modeling object describing shape of molecules with a size of several nano maters. We may also expect the rigid body dynamics calculation can be applied using general-purpose 3D CG software. Here, our example of using Blender, a 3D CG animation software is demonstrated. Please note the illustrated motions are not determined experimentaly by biologist, but are predictions. They will be tools for understanding biological discussions. Blender is free software, and we are developing numbers of script file for Blender. Please download these scripts to modify and exchange the model, so that we might help biologist to construct biologically correct animations based on structural studies for proteins and biological macromoleculesby exchanging and improving Blender scripts.

            The artificial muscle reported by Hokkaido University and Kansai University demonstrated a possible actuator material using microtubules and kinesin. Fluorescent molecules have been introduced into the microtubules to facilitate observation with an optical microscope. In order to construct a detailed 3D model a conforcal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) was used at a resolution approaching super resolution. The arrangement of microtubules, which is a cylindrical structure, was visualized, and we attempted to construct a three-dimensional model of microtubules.</p>

               A mesh model by cylinders of microtubule that fits the three-dimensional volume of the observed microtubule are constructed. The three-dimensional volume data are convert the iso-surface polygon mesh model by ImageJ software. Then, the cylinder objects are fitted into the volume using Blender.  Two areas, a dense area and a surface area that represents the overall volume, were created and saved with export STL.

          To find a nice fit of cylinder models for the observed iso-surface mesh object a semi-transparent display was useful overlaying the structure. As a result, many filaments had a length of about 4 µm, and filaments of about 7.5 µm were observed. The size will differ depending on the condition of the specimen.

              In Blender, the model represented by a cylinder or polygon can be used as a rigid body to simulate the movement when a force is applied by the physical calculation function. The action of kinesin molecule was introduced to the model of microtubules represented by the arrangement of cylinders, and the force to pull the microtubules was applied.

          Using two microtubule filaments a basic contractile elemment is considered. These filaments are pulled by introduced kinesin multimer complex. Polarity of microtubule filaments are supposed to oposite direction. In this model a kinesin multimer complex has two arms where the motor primitive is assigned to slide on the microtubule filaments. Thus, four arms of kinesin multimer complex used in the real experiment will work in the same way.

          Furthermore, by connecting multiple microtubules and arranging three motion models, a contraction motion was made with the same structure as the artificial muscle gel. This is an example model to understand how the whole mesh structure is contracted by the motion of kinesin mmultimer complex.

      <h2 class="docs-header">CONSTRUCTION OF SKELETAL MUSCLE FILAMENT MODEL</h2>
      <p>
        The muscle filaments that make up skeletal muscle are arranged in a hexagonal lattice, and are known to have a unique arrangement in vertebrates. Further, when the muscle contracts, the lattice spacing becomes shorter corresponding to the extension of the muscle cell. Here, we attempted to confirm the intermolecular interaction between actin and myosin on the model by reconstructing the structure of the filament lattice, which was not dealt with in the conventional sarcomeric shortening model. Facilitated the creation of a model that was also contracted. I tried to utilize the particle function of Blender. In order to nest two particle models, one is a particle model with leaves on the branches of the tree, and the other is a particle model of the trunk with multiple branches. Apply the particle instance modifier to the upper part of the branches, and use the Use Modifier in the particle panel. Turn on Stack. The total number of myosin heads generated from the branches is the total number.

If you use the Group function of blender, you can register and reuse the parts that consist of multiple objects, so you can build a similar model with the Gorup function. A script can be used to copy or place multiple objects, or the objects created with particles can be converted into ordinary objects. A script is used to change the attributes of multiple objects.

      <h2 class="docs-header">PREDICTION OF SMOOTH MUSCLE FILAMENT MODEL</h2>
      <p>
        Since smooth muscle does not have a sarcomere structure, its detailed structure is not so clear, but a hypothesis has been proposed for the contraction mechanism. We tried to create a model based on the hypothesis that the unit structure of contraction is composed of actin from the textbook explanation. We created a state in which this unit structure constitutes a network connected to a mesh centered on a mass known as a dens body. And it was illustrated that the contraction of the whole network is given by shortening the unit structure. I created a unit structure with the Group function of Blender, created a mesh structure with armature so that it could be given an action, and pasted multiple unit structures registered with Group. Since the myosin filament was created in the same manner as the skeletal muscle, it has the same movement as the neighbor, but it is not synchronized, and it is expected that the sliding length of the filament is not fixed.

Structural studies of smooth muscles are explained in various textbooks, mainly by pioneering reports by electron microscopes, but with the recent development of fluorescence microscopy, the visualization of muscle filaments in smooth muscle cells provides new insights. It is being obtained, and it is expected that the detailed structure will be revealed.

               <p>
			         Although it is a function to generate multiple shape models, the general-purpose functions for creating human models are the main functions, so in such molecular model creation, it is often not possible to create the desired model even when trying to proceed with the manual. It was efficient to improve the already created script. There is also an addon that makes it easy to create tree branches and leaves, so there is room for use. In the Rotation panel, you can specify the method of changing the orientation of the object to be generated, but since it shakes randomly, you will be searching for a good value for appearance.
